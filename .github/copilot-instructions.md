## Project Overview
This is an AI Pet Health Monitor application built with React and Vite. The project aims to help pet owners detect early signs of health issues through AI-powered photo analysis and behavioral pattern tracking.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern features, consider Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach
- **State Management**: React hooks and context API
- **AI Integration**: Ready for future ML model integration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow JSX best practices and accessibility standards
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement responsive design principles
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Use modern JavaScript/ES6+ features

## Component Structure
- Create reusable UI components in `/src/components/`
- Organize components by feature areas (health analysis, pet profiles, etc.)
- Use proper prop validation and default props
- Implement error boundaries for robust error handling

## Pet Health Focus Areas
When generating code, consider these key features:
- Photo upload and analysis interfaces
- Pet profile management
- Health tracking dashboards
- Behavioral pattern logging
- Veterinary consultation features
- Health alerts and notifications

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design for pet owners of all technical skill levels
- Use warm, friendly colors and pet-themed imagery
- Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities
- Optimize for both mobile and desktop experiences
- Provide clear feedback for AI analysis results

## Data Handling
- Implement proper form validation for pet health data
- Handle image uploads efficiently
- Prepare for future API integrations
- Consider offline functionality for basic features
- Ensure data privacy and security best practices

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize image loading and processing
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Consider PWA features for mobile experience
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
