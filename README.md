**Note**: This is a demonstration application showcasing the potential of AI in pet healthcare. The AI analysis features are simulated for demo purposes. In a production environment, these would be powered by trained machine learning models and real veterinary data.

**Disclaimer**: This application is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional veterinary care. Always consult with a qualified veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of your pet's health concerns.+ Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
